# Description

This folder contains four exercises from the second partial exam of the course "Programaci√≥n de computadores" of the CESMAG University.

# Exercises

## Exercise 1

Write a program that generates 100 random numbers between 1 and 4000 and shows them on the screen with their corresponding Roman numerals the printout must be seen as follows:

| Position | Number | Roman |
| -------- | ------ | ----- |
| 1        | 10     | X     |
| 2        | 20     | XX    |

## Exercise 2

Write a program that generates 100 random numbers between 1 and 10000 and shows them on the screen with their corresponding binary numbers and validate if they are Fibonacci numbers the printout must be seen as follows:

| Position | Number | Binary |
| -------- | ------ | ------ |
| 1        | 1      | 01     |
| 2        | 5      | 101    |

## Exercise 3

Carry out a program that generates 100 random numbers and stores them, in addition to generating the corresponding binary number for each number stored, it must be done with the method of successive divisions, the printout must be seen as follows:

| Position | Number | Binary |
| -------- | ------ | ------ |
| 1        | 10     | 1010   |
| 2        | 20     | 10100  |

## Exercise 4

Create a program that generates 100 random numbers between 1 and 4000 which must be stored, but their Roman number must be generated, in addition to the generated number it must be specified if it belongs to the Fibonacci series the printout must be seen as follows:

| Position | Number | Roman | Fibonacci |
| -------- | ------ | ----- | --------- |
| 1        | 1      | I     | Yes       |
| 2        | 20     | XX    | No        |
